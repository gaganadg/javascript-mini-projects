JAVA SCRIPT MINI PROJECTS

This repository contains small projects I built while learning JavaScript.  
The goal was to understand how JavaScript works with HTML and CSS to make web pages interactive.

Projects Included:
To-Do List
A simple task manager where I can:
Add tasks ,Mark tasks as completed  and Delete tasks .
Through this project, I learned how to create elements using JavaScript and update the DOM dynamically.


 Digital Clock
A live digital clock that updates every second.

This helped me understand:
 The Date object  
 setInterval() 
 Updating content on the page in real time  



 Theme Changer
A light and dark mode toggle.

From this, I learned how to:
 Use classList to change styles  
 Handle button click events  
 Switch themes using CSS classes  



 Simple Calculator
A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

This project helped me practice:
Taking input from users  
Writing functions  
Using condition checks  
Displaying results dynamically  


This repository represents my hands-on practice while building my foundation in JavaScript.
